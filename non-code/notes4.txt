Notes for Phase 4

Workspace
	Console(truth table + boolean equations)
		Functions
			> Boolean equation to circuit
				(Kenny) -> Pathfind algo from output to intended input
						> i_wire are crossable blocks, but make note of it being an i_wire
						> i_wires that are crossed will be replaced with crossing blocks.
				-> Auto clip for wires (automatically matches output to input)
				-> Switches instead of variable blocks
				-> the number of times it appears in the boolean eq, is the number of wires it needs to be spaces vertically
					> conservative so each switch can get wired up to the corresponding input
					> A * (A + B)
						A B
						| |
					   /+ |
					AND-OR/

			K > Simplifying boolean equation (make boolean equation into its simplest form)

	Layout
		-> Help Menu page (gives instructions on how to use circuits)

		Quizlets Maker Page
			> Quizlets will just be normal Circuit files but with certain constraints place on them
				- Once made through the Maker Page, it will appear as a normal Circuit in your Profile
				- You can edit the Quizlet, but you cannot add Quizlet constraints to any normally made Circuit(through the Workspace).
			> Students can clone their professor's Circuit file and try to solve it.

			> Another tab in the console called -- Quizlet
				-> Displays the number of each component you have left
				-> Check Correctness -- checks if the circuit you have on the grid matches the quizlet constraints

		Layout of Maker Page
			-> Problem - the objective of this quizlet
			-> Circuit constraints - any constraints put on the problem solver
				- Limit amount of circuit components
				- etc, more to be added
			-> Correct Answer - can be inputted as
				- Boolean equation
				- Circuit (made through Workspace)
					- Choose Circuit file locally
					- Choose Circuit from Profile
			-> Tags


		-> QA page (contact info and how to send buggy circuits to us)

	Tools
		-> Load - load any circuit files that are yours (can only load files that you are marked as OWNER)

Profile

	Profile name and Utilities (on the top)
		> Logo - brings you to splash screen (Reef)

		> New
			-> Opens a blank Main Workspace (Reef)

		> Search Bar
			-> Depending on which page you are on, searchs through all results and finds circuit based on 
				> if you are on "Shared with me" it will only search through all the shared results
					- name 			Nelson
					- tags 			#public
					- owner 		owner:nelson@gmail.com
					- shared 		shared:mdadurian@gmail.com

					> all search results are tokenized by a space

			-> Syntax: <name> #<tag> owner:<owner> shared:<shared>
				-example: Nelson's Circuit #public #cse220 owner:nelsontsui33@gmail.com shared:mdadurian@gmail.com

					This would filter for 
							any name containing "Nelson's" and "Circuit" 
						and any tags with "#public" and "#cse220" 
						and any owners with nelsontsui33@gmail.com
						and any shared with mdadurian@gmail.com

			-> Everything by default is filtered on 
				> owner: currentUser && shared: currentUser || tag.contains(#public)
				> after you get this initial list of elements, you filter further based on the search query.

		> Notifications (Reef)
			-> alerts when something is shared with 
			-> tooltip that shows all notifications

			Implementation: 
				- On submission or share, it checks the shared column in Circuit file, then appends a new row into the notifications table
				- on reloading of the profile page, it shows the number of unread notifications
				- Upon clicking the bell
					- prompts a tooltip displaying all your notifications.
				- Upon clicking the notification
					- finds the corresponding notification in the Notifications table and deletes it
					- get the Circuit File Name and Circuit File Owner from the notification
						- types into the search bar: <Circuit File Name> owner:<Circuit File Owner>
							or
						- filters on Owner(Circuit File Name) and Circuit Name(Circuit File Owner) in the Circuit table

		> Upload **
			-> Prompts File Manager and allows you to select which file you wish to upload
			-> Dragging a file with the correct extension into the List of Circuits interface will automatically upload the file to the datastore (with you as the owner)

		> Profile Name/Logout (Reef)
			-> Brings you to Splash Screen		

		> Each Circuit listing has (Reef maybe some parts)
			-> Open (double click on listing)
			-> Delete (prompts asking if you are SURE you want to delete)
			-> Get Shareable Link -- theboolapp.com/<owner>+<name> (only available if public)
			-> Share Option
			-> Clone as owner(if not you Circuit) - copies Circuit file and puts into your account


Notification Table Structure
	- Owner (who is being notified)
	- Type
	- Circuit File Name
	- Circuit File Owner
