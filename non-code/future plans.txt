-- Notes for when we decide to continue the project --

-- Workspace --
	** > Optimize Circuit evaluator
		- Without a delay - iterate the components(without recursion/calling next()) 
		- With a delay - recursively call through setTimeout then next iteration using next() function

		- Make CROSS and T wires able to take 2 inputs without glitching out.
			- Prob won't fix unless we are doing this after project over
			> CROSS and T wires CANNOT be used as OR gates, two inputs into them is very buggy!

	> Make boolean equation blocks a passthrough, rather than a dead end.
		- similar to buffer or print block

	> fix clipOnPlace
		- L wires, cross wires, checking if a component can be rotated

	> sort quizlet counter components by number which ones have finite amounts(don't show ones that are infinite)

	> change attribute editor to only show needed inputs(textbox, etc)
		- remove delay from all wires
		- remove message from all but print

	> Slider toggle for delay(since delays are all the same)
		or
	> Make delays in milliseconds(complications due to async and timing)

	> Optimize truth-table to boolean equations

	> Add wires and have the same variables hook up to the same inputs on boolean equation to circuit

	(HARD) > Allow for multi users to edit the same workspace(HARD)

-- Profile --
	> save/save as feature, 
		> allow overwriting of a certain circuit when you press save and name it the same name as something else
		> if same as and is the same name then rename it <name>(1).

	> Optimize search bar, use ancestor queries to store tags and shared.
		- use database query functions to search through Circuit files in the datastore, rather loading all of them and search it 	string by string.

	> Redo profile page - making more maintainable, cleaner looking, more mobile friendly
		- Make look better: Shareable link prompt menu, Share option prompt menu

-- Splash --
	> Redo splash screen - more maintainable, cleaner looking, more pictures

	> On site documentation, tutorials, videos, demo circuit downloads, etc
