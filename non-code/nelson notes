Circuit Evaluator notes

> Implement 
	- buffer -- delays will only be for logic gates(including buffer)

	- crossing -- allows circuits to pass through top

> Delays - sort the bftList by delay order, if none have delays then doesn't matter the order but if they have delay then execute lowest delay, then subtract the lowest from second lowest and wait that time and keep doing it for wait(bftList[i+1].delay - bftList[i].delay).



Delays:
	AND, OR, XOR, NOT, BUFFER

finished
	> fix bug when two outputs are pointed into each other, it breaks
		- check input locations

	> NOT gate no longer signal generating(only switches and on-blocks)

	> Circuit to boolean equation
		> find end block, then breadthTraversal and append to left and right of root(check whiteboard)

	> get rid of duplicate components in bftList


** Add new blocks **
	example: Light Bulb

	component.js 
		> make new constant at top -	var LIGHT_BOX_COMPONENT = "LIGHT"
		> make new function -			function light_box(label, x, y){}

	grid.js
		> add to getComponentByType(comp,x,y);

	index.html
		> add to <div class = "cmenu"></div>

	images.js
		> add active image constant
		> add regular image constant
		> add to getImageByComponentType(component);
