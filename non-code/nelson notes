Circuit Evaluator notes

> Implement 
	- buffer -- delays will only be for logic gates(including buffer)
	- switch -- propogates through everything beginning from the switch
	- crossing -- allows circuits to pass through top
> Circuit to boolean equation

> get rid of duplicate components in bftList



finished

> fix bug when two outputs are pointed into each other, it breaks
	- check input locations
> NOT gate no longer signal generating(only switches and on-blocks)
