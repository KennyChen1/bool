Nelson's notes

> Implement 
	- buffer -- delays will only be for logic gates(including buffer)

> Delays - sort the bftList by delay order, if none have delays then doesn't matter the order but if they have delay then execute lowest delay, then subtract the lowest from second lowest and wait that time and keep doing it for wait(bftList[i+1].delay - bftList[i].delay).
	> remove delay option from all wires when buffer is added
	> AND, OR, XOR
	> NOT, BUFFER only stop on evaluation when delay is > 0

> implement ondelete() and onplace() functionality - when remove ON_BOX, whatever is on (that should be off) remains on
	- eg when you delete an ON_BOX it propagates a 0 through then removes itself
		- when you place an ON_BOX it propagates a 1 through
		- when you delete a switch it propagates an 0 through(unless it is already 0)
		- when you place a switch, it propagates a 1 through.

	- insert where you delete an item
	- insert where you place an item
	- take into consideration, mass rotation, mass selection, mass movement, cut/copy/paste, deletion.

> fix boolean equation and truth table to accept multiple character labels

> render crossing correctly - depending on which i_wire is active, render accordingly

> new images for crossing, light_bulb, switch

> boolean equation to circuit - placing wires down
	- pathfinder algo - pathfind from gate A to gate B
		- i_wires are traversable, when u crossover an i_wire, it replaces it with a crossing wire.
		- breadth search, maybe A*?
	- clip onplace function, automatically set direction to match inputs/outputs of already placed wires/gates 
	- based on the found path, select the corresponding wire.
		> say we have path = [prevLoc, currLoc, nextLoc];
			when we are on currLoc and 
				prevLoc is above
				nextLoc is right
			then we would want an L_wire facing up.

Check if name exists when submitting if not add (1)
	> check if name exists.
		if exists: add a (1). eg) helloworld(1).
		else: accept

--bugs to fix--

--for Kenny--
	> clipboard needs to paste in as components, not Objects
		- manually placing wire give correct component.logic()
		- pasting a wire does not give correct component.logic()
	> Add XOR and multiple character Label support to truth-table.js functions


finished
	> fix bug when two outputs are pointed into each other, it breaks
		- check input locations

	> NOT gate no longer signal generating(only switches and on-blocks)

	> Circuit to boolean equation
		> find end block, then breadthTraversal and append to left and right of root(check whiteboard)

	> get rid of duplicate components in bftList

	> implemented crossing

	bug fix > 	Evaluator, make sure all outputs assign themselves to correct inputIndex
		-when we have 2 sets of i_wires connected to a cross and we turn both sets on them try to turn them off, it breaks(they dont turn off).


** Add new blocks **
	example: Light Bulb

	component.js 
		> make new constant at top -	var LIGHT_BOX_COMPONENT = "LIGHT"
		> make new function -			function light_box(label, x, y){}
		> if is wire or unarygate, add to isWire() or isUnaryGate() functions

	grid.js
		> add to getComponentByType(comp,x,y);

	index.html
		> add to <div class = "cmenu"></div>

	images.js
		> add active image constant
		> add regular image constant
		> add to getImageByComponentType(component);
