Notes for Phase 3

Workspace
	Console(truth table + boolean equations)
		Functions
			> Boolean equation to circuit
			> Circuit to boolean equation
			K > Parser for boolean equations
			K > Truth table to boolean equation
			K > Boolean equation to truth table
			K > Simplifying boolean equation (make boolean equation into its simplest form)

	Layout
		-> Truth table tab layout
		-> Boolean equations tab layout

	Tools
		-> Load - load any circuit files that are yours (can only load files that you are marked as OWNER)

	Evaluator
		-> Add 
			- button(sends a short signal)
			- switch(sends a constant signal)
			- crossing (+ shape, allows signal to travel over another signal)
		-> Evaluation
			currently -> looks for every signal generating circuit and propagates on them. (depth first traversal on every SGC)
			changes ->  either breadth first traversal on every SGC or tick based evaluation

Profile

	Profile name and Utilities (on the top)
		> Logo - brings you to splash screen

		> New
			-> Opens a blank Main Workspace

		> Search Bar
			-> Depending on which page you are on, searchs through all results and finds circuit based on 
				> if you are on "Shared with me" it will only search through all the shared results
					- name 			Nelson
					- tags 			#public
					- owner 		owner:nelson@gmail.com
					- shared 		shared:mdadurian@gmail.com

					> all search results are tokenized by a space

			-> Syntax: <name> #<tag> owner:<owner> shared:<shared>
				-example: Nelson's Circuit #public #cse220 owner:nelsontsui33@gmail.com shared:mdadurian@gmail.com

					This would filter for 
							any name containing "Nelson's" and "Circuit" 
						and any tags with "#public" and "#cse220" 
						and any owners with nelsontsui33@gmail.com
						and any shared with mdadurian@gmail.com

			-> Everything by default is filtered on 
				> owner: currentUser && shared: currentUser || tag.contains(#public)
				> after you get this initial list of elements, you filter further based on the search query.

		> Notifications
			-> alerts when something is shared with 
			-> tooltip that shows all notifications

		> Upload **
			-> Prompts File Manager and allows you to select which file you wish to upload
			-> Dragging a file with the correct extension into the List of Circuits interface will automatically upload the file to the datastore (with you as the owner)

		> Profile Name/Logout
			-> Brings you to Splash Screen		

		> Each Circuit listing has
			-> Open (double click on listing)
			-> Delete (prompts asking if you are SURE you want to delete)
			-> Get Shareable Link -- <owner><name>
			-> Share Option
			-> Clone as owner(if not you Circuit) - copies Circuit file and puts into your account

	> check if name exists.
		if exists: add a (1). eg) helloworld(1).
		else: accept
