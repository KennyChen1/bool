Phase 2

Front-end
	Workspace
		Component Manipulation
			-> Save locally
			-> Load locally
			-> Mass Rotation - rotate everything within a selection
				-> rotate each item individually
				-> rotate everything relative to the origin of the selection
			-> Mass deletion - delete everything within a selection
			-> Mass movement - move everything within a selection
			-> Components on drag have a transparent image drawn on the cursor
			-> Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste

		Layout
			-> Truth table tab layout
			-> Boolean equations tab layout

			-> Make another div(similar to Attribute Editor that is for submission)

		Evaluator
			-> Add 
				- button(sends a short signal)
				- switch(sends a constant signal)
				- crossing (+ shape, allows signal to travel over another signal)
			-> Evaluation
				currently -> looks for every signal generating circuit and propagates on them. (depth first traversal on every SGC)
				changes ->  either breadth first traversal on every SGC or tick based evaluation

	Profile Page
		Layout - as Wireframe suggests

		Categories - each category displays different things
			> All Circuits - shows all circuits specified by the categories below
			> Profile - shows all circuits with the owner as your Google Account
			> Shared with me - shows all circuits with your Google Account as one of the shared accounts
			> Public - shows all circuits with the #public tag


Back-end
	Submit - uses the same functions as "load locally" to create a string to send to datastore
	Login/Logout
		- if logged in - prompts Authentication Page
		- if logged out - brings to Splash Screen
	Exit
		- if logged in - brings to Profile Page
		- if logged out - brings to Splash Screen 


Datastore
	Storage Format
		Circuit
			- Owner - owner of the circuit
			- Shared - who can view/clone the circuit
			- Circuit-content - String which stores the contents of the circuit
			- Quizlet-constrains - any constraints which the creator has put on this circuit
			- Tags - any tag that has been given to the circuit(helpful for searching)
